package com.core.override.antn;

/*This example shows the use of @override annotation.
 @Override annotation is used when we override a method in sub class.
 it is not mandatory to use this annotation while overriding the method.But its a good programming 
 practice to use it because of the following  advantages:

 1.If programmer makes any mistake such as wrong method name, wrong parameter types 
 while overriding, you would get a compile time error.
 As by using this annotation you instruct compiler that you are overriding this method.
 If you donâ€™t use the annotation then the sub class method would behave as a new method (not the overriding method) in sub class.

 2.It improves the readability of the code.
